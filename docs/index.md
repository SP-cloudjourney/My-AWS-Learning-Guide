Thank you for visiting my learning portfolio. This site documents my personal journey as I prepare for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (SAA C03) certification. It is a hands-on project where I learn in public by breaking down complex cloud concepts into practical, beginner-friendly explanations.

The goal of this site is twofold. First, to deepen my understanding of AWS services through writing and teaching. Second, to organise my learning in a way that helps with long-term understanding and recall. Each topic reflects not only what I have studied, but also how I interpret and apply key concepts. These range from core services like EC2 and S3 to areas such as identity management, networking, and architectural design.

Although this site is primarily a personal resource, I have chosen to make it public. Anyone who is interested, whether a recruiter, a fellow learner, or a future colleague, is welcome to explore how I think through technical topics and track my progress in cloud computing.
